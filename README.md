# Analysis-of-Traffic-Accidents-vs.-Environment
## Objective
Analyze the probability of highway-rail grade crossing accidents regarding environment factors (temperature, weather condition, visibility)
## Method
-	Collected dataset from data.gov; programmed in Python in Jupyter Notebook
-	Utilized pandas to read csv dataset, extracted variables, and do EDA
-	Created stacked bar charts and histogram for each factor vs. the number of accidents;
-	Utilized sklearn to do Naive Bayes: GaussianNB for temperature, MultinomialNB for weather and visibility
